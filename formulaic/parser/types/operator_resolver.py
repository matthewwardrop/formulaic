    Resolves which `Operator` instance should be used for a given operator

    This class should be subclassed and have `.operators` and/or `.resolve()`
    overridden in order to achieve the desired formula algebra.

    Note: most users will probably be interested in extending/subclassing
    `DefaultOperatorResolver`, which implements the default formula operator
    logic. You should subclass this class directly only if you want to start
    from scratch.
