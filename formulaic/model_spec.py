    A container for the metadata used to generate a `ModelMatrix` instance.

    This object can also be used to create a `ModelMatrix` instance that
    respects the encoding choices made during the generation of this `ModelSpec`
    instance.

    Attributes:
        Configuration:
            formula: The formula for which the model matrix was (and/or will be)
                generated.
            materializer: The materializer used (and/or to be used) to
                materialize the formula into a matrix.
            ensure_full_rank: Whether to ensure that the generated matrix is
                "structurally" full-rank (features are not included which are
                known to violate full-rankness).
            na_action: The action to be taken if NA values are found in the
                data. Can be one of: "drop" (the default), "raise" or "ignore".
            output: The desired output type (as interpreted by the materializer;
                e.g. "pandas", "sparse", etc).
            cluster_by: How to cluster terms/columns during materialization. Can
                be one of: "none" (the default) or "numerical_factors" (in which
                case terms are clustered based on their sharing of the same
                numerical factors; like patsy).

        State (these attributes are only populated during materialization):
            structure: The model matrix structure resulting from materialization.
            transform_state: The state of any stateful transformations that took
                place during factor evaluation.
            encoder_state: The state of any stateful transformations that took
                place during encoding.

    Class attributes:
        SENTINEL: Can be used as a default fallback in signatures (e.g. stateful
            transforms) to aid in typing. Must not be modified.
