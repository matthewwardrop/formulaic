    Symbolically differentiate a `Term` instance with respect to one or more `wrt`.

        term: The `Term` instance to differentiate.
        wrt: The variables by which to differentiate.
        use_sympy: Whether to interpret factor token strings using sympy. If
            `True`, symbolic factors like `log(x)` can be differentiated with
            respect to `x`. If `False`, factor token strings must match the

        - This method takes into account the chain rule/etc.

            the factors can be properly interpreted by `sympy`. For example, `I(x)`
