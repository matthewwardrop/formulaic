    "## How does contrast coding work?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, contrast coding transforms categorical vectors into a matrix\n",
    "of numbers that can be used during modeling. If your data has $K$ mutually\n",
    "exclusive categories, these matrices typically consist of $K-1$ columns. This\n",
    "reduction in dimensionality reflects the fact that membership of the $K$th\n",
    "category could be inferred from the lack of membership in any other category,\n",
    "and so is redundant in the presence of a global intercept. You can read more\n",
    "about this in the [full rankness](#guaranteeing-structural-full-rankness)\n",
    "discussion below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step toward generating numerical vectors from categorical data is to\n",
    "dummy encode it. This transforms the single vector of $K$ categories into $K$\n",
    "boolean vectors, each having a $1$ only in rows that are members of the\n",
    "corresponding category. If you do not have a global intercept, you can directly\n",
    "use this dummy encoding with the full $K$ columns and contrasts are unnecessary.\n",
    "This is not always the case, which requires you to reduce the rank of your\n",
    "coding by thinking about contrasts (or differences) between the levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this dimension reduction using \"contrasts\" looks like constructing\n",
    "a $K \\times (K-1)$ \"coding matrix\" that describes the contrasts of interest. You\n",
    "can then post-multiply your dummy-encoded columns by it. That is: $$ E = DC $$\n",
    "where $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times (K-1)}$ is the contrast coded categorical\n",
    "data, $D \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{N \\times K}$ is the dummy encoded data, and $C \\in\n",
    "\\mathbb{R}^{K \\times (K-1)}$ is the coding matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to construct a coding matrix is to start with a \"coefficient\n",
    "matrix\" $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times K}$ which describes the contrasts that you\n",
    "want the coefficients of a trained linear regression model to represent (with\n",
    "columns representing the untransformed levels, and rows representing the\n",
    "transforms). For a consistently chosen set of contrasts, this matrix will be\n",
    "full-rank, and the inverse of this matrix will have a constant column\n",
    "representing the global intercept. Removing this column results in the $K \\times\n",
    "(K-1)$ coding matrix that should be apply to the dummy encoded data in order for\n",
    "the coefficients to have the desired interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted all of the levels to be compared to the first level,\n",
    "we would build a matrix $Z$ as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Z =& \\left(\\begin{array}{c c c c}\n",

    "-1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n",

    "\\therefore Z^{-1} =& \\left(\\begin{array}{c c c c}\n",

    "0 & 0 & 1\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is none other than the default \"treatment\" coding described below, which\n",
    "applies one-hot coding to the categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while your choice of contrast coding will change\n",
    "the interpretation and values of your coefficients, all contrast encodings\n",
    "ultimately result in equivalent regressions, and it is possible to\n",
